  <ul>
    <li>
      Set Up Django Project: Begin by setting up a new Django project. You
      can do this by installing Django using pip and then creating a new
      project using the django-admin command-line tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design Models: Define models to represent your portfolio items such
      as projects, skills, education, and experiences. These models will
      define the structure of your data and how it will be stored in the
      database.
    </li>
    <li>
      Interface: Use Django's built-in admin interface to easily manage
      your portfolio content. You can register your models with the admin
      site to create, update, and delete portfolio items directly from a
      web interface. Create Views: Define views to handle requests and
      render templates for different pages of your portfolio website. For
      example, you may have views to display a list of projects,
      individual project details, skills, etc. </li>
      <li>Templates: Create HTML templates for each page of your portfolio website. Use Django's
      template language to dynamically render data from your models in the
      HTML templates.</li>
      <li> Files: Store static files such as CSS,
      JavaScript, and images in the static directory of your Django
      project. Link these static files in your HTML templates to style and
      enhance the appearance of your portfolio website. </li>
      <li>URL Patterns:
      Define URL patterns in your Django project's urls.py file to map
      URLs to views. This allows users to navigate to different pages of
      your portfolio website using clean and user-friendly URLs.</li>
      <li>Deployment: Once your Django portfolio website is ready, deploy it
      to a web server or a hosting platform. You can use platforms like
      Heroku, PythonAnywhere, or AWS to deploy your Django project.</li>
      <li>Continuous Improvement: Regularly update and improve your portfolio
      website with new projects, skills, and experiences. Consider adding
      features such as contact forms, blog sections, or integration with
      third-party services to enhance your portfolio's functionality.</li>
