        <strong>Using MongoDB:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema Design:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Define collections such as Rooms, Guests, Reservations,
                Transactions, Employees, etc., each storing documents in a
                JSON-like format.
              </li>
              <li>
                Embed related information within documents or reference other

            </ul>
          </li>

            <strong>Flexible Data Model:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Take advantage of MongoDB's flexibility to accommodate changes
                in requirements and accommodate unstructured data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use features like arrays and nested documents to represent
                complex relationships.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                MongoDB's horizontal scalability makes it suitable for handling
                large volumes of data and high concurrency.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sharding can be used to distribute data across multiple servers
                and ensure performance and reliability.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Create indexes on frequently queried fields to improve query
                performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use MongoDB's powerful query language to retrieve, filter, and
                manipulate data as needed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Leverage MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for complex data
                processing tasks such as grouping, sorting, and calculating
                aggregates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Perform analytics and generate reports directly within the
                database.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Set up replica sets to ensure data redundancy and automatic

              </li>
              <li>
                Implement backup and restore procedures to protect against data
                loss and corruption.
