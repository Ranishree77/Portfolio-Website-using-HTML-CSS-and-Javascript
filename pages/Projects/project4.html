        <strong>Responsive Layouts:</strong> Designing layouts that adjust
        dynamically based on the screen size, orientation, and resolution of the
        device. This typically involves using CSS techniques such as media
        queries to apply different styles based on viewport dimensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fluid Grids:</strong> Implementing fluid grid systems that allow
        content to scale proportionally across different screen sizes. This
        ensures that content remains readable and accessible on devices of
        various widths.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible Images and Media:</strong> Using CSS techniques like
        max-width: 100% to ensure that images and media elements scale
        appropriately within their containers, preventing overflow and
        maintaining visual integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Touch-Friendly Navigation:</strong> Creating touch-friendly
        navigation menus and controls that are easy to tap and interact with on
        touch-enabled devices. This may involve using larger tap targets,
        implementing swipe gestures, and avoiding hover-dependent interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optimized Typography:</strong> Choosing font sizes, line
        heights, and spacing that are legible and comfortable to read on smaller
        screens. Additionally, considering responsive typography techniques such
        as viewport-based units (vw, vh) to ensure text scales appropriately
        across devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimizing performance by
        minimizing file sizes, reducing HTTP requests, and leveraging techniques
        like lazy loading to improve page load times on mobile networks. This
        may also involve optimizing animations and transitions to ensure smooth
        performance on mobile devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Testing and ensuring
        compatibility with various mobile browsers and platforms, including iOS
        Safari, Chrome for Android, and others. This may involve using vendor
        prefixes and polyfills to ensure consistent behavior across different
        environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring that mobile and tablet
        interfaces are accessible to users with disabilities by adhering to web
        accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG). This includes providing
        alternative text for images, using semantic HTML markup, and
        implementing keyboard navigation support.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</strong> Leveraging modern web
        technologies like service workers and web app manifests to create
        progressive web apps that offer native-like experiences on mobile and
        tablet devices. This allows users to install web apps to their home
        screens and access them offline.
