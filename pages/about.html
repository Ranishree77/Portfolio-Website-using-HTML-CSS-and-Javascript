        <h1>RANISHREE ANEGUNDI</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate software engineer currently based in Fremont,
          California. I am currently enrolled in the Masters of Computer Science
          program at SFBU. I'm always eager to learn and grow in the
          ever-evolving world of technology, particularly fascinated by the
          potential of Artificial Intelligence.

          Outside of work, I enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful California
          nature. These outdoor adventures help me clear my head and often spark
          creative problem-solving approaches. I'm a strong believer in
          continuous learning and actively participate in online courses and
          workshops to stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.
          As a team player, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can
          share my knowledge and learn from others.
